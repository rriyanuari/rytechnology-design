        The background of the establishment of this blog, because we as blog writers are eager to provide the information we get and share with website visitors to get new insights about the various information we get.

        Rytechnology itself only has 2 members. And we really like things about computer science and the internet.

        Maybe that's all we can say about this website. More or less sorry. Hopefully this website can always provide quality content and of course it can be useful.
